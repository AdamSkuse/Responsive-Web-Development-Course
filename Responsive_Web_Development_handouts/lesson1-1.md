Welcome to **Responsive Web Development** course. I'm Guilherme Muller and I'm a web developer. This course was made for those people that are feeling a bit lost in this new front end development reality of preprocessors, build tools and task runners. I'll show you how to integrate your development skills with an automated workflow that makes our life easier.

You are going to learn how to:

* Setup the NPM package manager and Gulp, the task runner we'll use throughout the course
* Install and configure Gulp plugins like Sass and BrowserSync, which reloads your browser automatically when files are updated
* Plan and code a web page from scratch, from the PSD file to the final HTML and CSS code
* Use the BEM methodology for class naming and Sass partials for better code maintenance
* Build a responsive grid system that you can use in your projects

Some prerequisites:

* Basic experience with HTML and CSS. There's no need to have knowledge of Sass, because it's similar to CSS, and you can learn along the lessons.
* A browser, a text editor, and a command line tool. I use Sublime Text editor which I think is the fastest and one of the more customizable. I'll also use the plugin Emmet which just saves a lot of time when coding HTML and CSS and a Sass plugin so that code highlighting works for these kinds of files. As for your command line tool, Mac users are generally better off because they already have the native macOS terminal which speaks the Unix language a lot of people are used to. Windows command prompt is somewhat bland so you may use tools like Commander.
* If you want to add the provided PSD file, you'll also need Photoshop or another program that can open this kind of file. However this is not required and not the main focus of the course and the design is also supplied as a PNG file. A browser is something that everyone has installed. As for the text editor, there are more and more options available each year. 

That's it for the introduction. Let's begin the development of our website by analyzing the design and planning how we will approach the HTML and CSS coding.
